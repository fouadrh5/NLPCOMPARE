# NLPCOMPARE
Python tool to compare 4 NLP tools (Stanford, Google SyntaxNet, spaCy and NLTK) in term of tokenization and POS features.

##Description:
    ##The idea of this script is to use the NLP parsers to generate the Part of speech tags and compare the result between the different parsers. 
    ##This Python script will be used to run any parser out of the following parsers and compare the Part of speach tags between them:
    ##Stanford parser
    ##Google parser
    ##SpaCY parser
    ##NLTK parser
    ##Also, the user has the option to run them one by one or to run them all on the same input file.
    ##This will save him/her a lot of time instead of waiting each parser to finish.
    ##All the options will be provided on easy-followed menu that will not terminate unless specified by the user.
    ##This script 
##Quick dependency to be able to run it
    ##Python 2.7.12 
    ##Install all the above mentioned parsers
    ##Xcode_11_beta_6
    ##Ensure that the location of this file to be under the Stanford directory

##Usage:
## You need to change the path from /Users/fouadomran/mytmp/ to a dirctory
##that has all the input file including the excel sheet
##python NLPCompare.py
##Then follow the questions asked by the script
##make sure all the provided files are being created in advance to
##prevent any issues in running the script or any unpleasant exceptions

##Workflow
##The workflow of the program will be as follow:
    ##The program will read the given input file (full path to the input file)
    ##Make sure that the input file is in ASCII Codec schema
    ##The program will output two types of files:
        ##1- Excel file (.xlsx) that has all the parsers that you have select like : parser name| POS |parser name | POS ...so on 
        ##and also will compare the result of each parser with each others along with generating some statisitics 
        ##2- the output file of each parser as generated by the parser with initial preprocessing i.e. before process it to be in the .xlsx format
